You sit eating your eggs and toast, as the sun rises over the hill. The house is quiet, the silence is peaceful. You work for the local police, and you are expecting a slow day. (At this point, actions around the house. Not much here, but the things are extremely helpful to the rest of the game, as you will not be returning here throughout the game.)
...
A radio call from you boss pulls you out of your slumber at the station. "We have a report of suspicious activity over on Bank Street, all units report." Your uniform is stained, and you must report in street clothes as a result. (Explore police station, nothing of much use to find. Maybe a pun or two. Exit to car)
...
You turn onto Bank Street and see a CIA helicopter over your house.
